Project build with in vanilla JavaScript consisting of a website that connects to the geolocation API and by using the leaflet library display the map geolocated to your address. When you clicked on the map it shows a form to fill out the type of activity you perform in that location, the cost, the duration and the name of the activity you did there. Once you fill all the fields for that form and hit enter that activity is saved in the Browser local storage through the localstorage API and also is added to the HTML as a list being displayed below the form. Was build following the guide in the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" created by Jonas Schmedtmann.
